# üß† Threat Intelligence

Welcome to the **Intelligence** section of my **Threat Intelligence Lab**! This folder is where I store and document various threat intelligence artifacts, such as Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), threat actor profiles, and intelligence reports. The goal is to track emerging threats and provide actionable intelligence for detection, mitigation, and response.

## üìå What‚Äôs Included

In this folder, you‚Äôll find key intelligence data and files related to:

- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**  
  IP addresses, domains, hashes, and other indicators used to identify malicious activity.

- **Threat Actor Profiles**  
  Detailed information about specific adversaries, their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

- **Intelligence Reports**  
  Comprehensive reports on identified threats, incidents, or trends, including relevant IOCs and TTPs.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

This folder is organized into the following key sections:

- **`ioc/`**  
  A collection of IOCs that include suspicious IPs, domains, file hashes, and URLs. These are updated regularly as new intelligence is collected.

- **`actor_profiles/`**  
  Profiles of known threat actors or threat groups, including detailed analysis of their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

- **`reports/`**  
  Full threat intelligence reports that provide a high-level overview of the threat landscape, emerging trends, and analysis of incidents.

---

## üìù Key Files

- **`example_iocs.json`**  
  A sample file containing a list of IOCs (IPs, domains) associated with a recent cyber attack.

- **`actor_profile_sample.md`**  
  A sample profile of a threat actor, detailing the TTPs and associated IOCs.

- **`example_report.md`**  
  A threat intelligence report summarizing a recent incident or a threat actor‚Äôs campaign, with IOCs and mitigation recommendations.

## üîç How to Use

- **Browse the IOCs**: Use the IOCs listed in the files to track and investigate suspicious activity in your environment.
- **Study the Threat Actor Profiles**: Understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by different threat actors to anticipate future threats.
- **Review the Reports**: Stay up-to-date with the latest threat intelligence reports and trends to better inform your detection and mitigation strategies.
