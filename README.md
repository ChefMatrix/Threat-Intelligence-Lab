# 🧠 Threat Intelligence Lab

Welcome to my **Threat Intelligence Lab**! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey and progress in learning about and applying threat intelligence concepts. As a beginner, this lab will focus on the basics, such as collecting Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), writing simple detection rules, and analyzing threat actor behaviors.

---

## 🎯 Goals
The main objectives of this lab are:
- **Learn** and apply threat intelligence concepts.
- **Create** detection methods (e.g., Sigma rules, LogScale queries).
- **Collect** and document IOCs (IPs, domains, file hashes).
- **Explore** and understand threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

---

## 📂 Structure

This repository is organized into the following main sections:

- **`Documentation/`**  
  Basic documentation and reports, including an overview of threat intelligence methods and progress.

- **`Detections/`**  
  Simple detection rules (e.g., Sigma, LogScale).

- **`Threat Hunting/`**  
  Custom Threat hunting queries.

- **`Intelligence/`**  
  Collection of IOCs (e.g., suspicious IPs, domains, hashes).
