TODO:
1. Start with Threat Intelligence Feeds:
   **Action**: Begin integrating public threat intelligence feeds (OSINT, governmental alerts, and commercial sources like Anomali or VirusTotal) into your SIEM. The idea here is to get a flow of incoming IOCs (IP addresses, domains, hashes) into your system for detection and alerting.
   **Why it helps**: This will provide a foundation of external threat intelligence that you can start acting on immediately.

2. Map IOCs to Detection Rules:
   **Action**: Use SIEM tools (Splunk, Elastic SIEM, QRadar) to write simple detection rules that correlate IOCs from your feeds. For instance, if an IOC shows up in a log, create a rule that raises an alert.
   **Why it helps**: It will get you used to translating intelligence into actionable detections. You'll start seeing how threat intelligence feeds into the real-time detection and alerting systems.

3. Create a Simple Threat Intelligence Sharing Framework:
   **Action**: Implement a basic TAXII/STIX-based sharing mechanism if your organisation collaborates with any external partners or industry groups. If not, focus on internal sharing of intelligence and alerts between teams (SOC, network admins, etc.).
   **Why it helps**: Collaboration is key, and learning how to share and receive intelligence in a structured way is critical for scaling your threat intelligence efforts.

4. Automate Detection and Response:
   **Action**: If possible, begin automating responses using tools like SOAR (Cortex XSOAR or Swimlane) to take actions based on threat intelligence (blocking malicious IPs, isolating endpoints).
   **Why it helps**: This will familiarise you with automation and allow you to see how larger enterprises handle alerts and responses at scale.

5. Establish an Intelligence Feedback Loop:
   **Action**: As you process intelligence, make sure there's a feedback loop to improve detection rules and response actions. Regularly test your rules with red team exercises or tools like Atomic Red Team to ensure the detections are working.
   **Why it helps**: This reinforces the idea that threat intelligence isn't static—it’s an ongoing process that needs constant refinement.
