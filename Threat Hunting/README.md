# 🔍 Threat Hunting

Welcome to the **Threat Hunting** section of my **Threat Intelligence Lab**! This folder is dedicated to storing and documenting custom threat hunting queries and techniques. Threat hunting is a proactive approach to cybersecurity, where we search for signs of malicious activity within the environment that may not be detected by traditional security measures.

## 📌 What’s Included

In this folder, you'll find threat hunting queries and techniques that focus on detecting suspicious or anomalous behavior, such as:

- **Custom Queries**  
  Search queries designed to detect specific attack patterns, behaviors, and anomalies.

- **Hunting Techniques**  
  Strategies and methods used to proactively identify threats before they cause significant damage.

## 📂 Folder Structure

This folder is organized into the following sections:

- **`queries/`**  
  Custom threat hunting queries for use in various security tools (e.g., SIEMs, EDRs, LogScale, Splunk).

- **`methods/`**  
  Descriptions of the techniques and methodologies used in threat hunting, including examples and best practices.

## 📝 Key Files

- **`example_hunting_query.yml`**  
  A sample threat hunting query designed to detect suspicious command-line arguments commonly used in attacks.

- **`hunting_methodology.md`**  
  A guide that outlines the steps involved in conducting effective threat hunting, from hypothesis generation to investigation.

- **`example_ttp_detection.md`**
